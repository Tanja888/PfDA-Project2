    "Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women. It can be described as changing and abnormal growth of breast cells while grouping of these cells leads to tumour formation [[1]](https://www.cancer.ie/cancer-information-and-support/cancer-types/breast-cancer). Breast cancer research by Wolberg, Street and Mangasarian from University of Wisconsin conducted in 1990s by analysing characteristics of cell nuclei in a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass is often used in machine learning and data analytics. [[2]](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) Diagnostic dataset was taken with the description of attributes that were measured in order to predict between two types of tumours, benign or malignant. Various classification machine learning algorithms were performed over the years on these data with different level of accuracy: Decision trees, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and k-Nearest Neighbors."
