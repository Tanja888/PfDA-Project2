## Programming for Data Analysis Project2
 
## Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset analysis

## About the Project
 The purpose of this project was to get an insight into some of the classification models for machine learning using Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.

## Technologies
 Python 3.9.13

## Starting Jupyter Notebook

 Jupyter Notebook can be started through command line by running jupyter notebook in Terminal for Linux and Mac or Command Prompt for Windows.[1] The notebook will automatically open in the browser, it is possible to navigate it through the dashboard that contains files, notebook with .ipynb extension, Readme file and all the other files uploaded for the project.

### Setup and Libraries
 Libraries used in the notebook 
  ```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import sklearn.neighbors as nei
    import sklearn.model_selection as mod
    from sklearn import svm
    from sklearn import metrics
    from sklearn import preprocessing
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
```

### Conclusion
 Trying various machine learning classification methods served as a good starting point for developing the idea on how those models perform in Python programming. In our project four methods were used: k-nearest neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and Random Forest.
